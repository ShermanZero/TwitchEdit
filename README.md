# TwitchEdit
 
After getting tired of spending the extra 10 seconds to navigate to my clip page directly, and then modify the URL by typing /edit at the end of it, I decided to write this little Chrome Extension which automates that process for you.  Once installed, any time you visit your clips page and click on a clip, you will see a brand new "Edit" icon which will take you directly to the clip in a **NEW TAB** (thank God) and allow you to edit it.

**THIS WILL NOT WORK IF YOUR CLIP HAS BEEN PUBLISHED FOR MORE THAN 24 HOURS, OR IF YOU'VE ALREADY PERSONALLY EDITED IT**
