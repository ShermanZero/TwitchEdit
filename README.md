# TwitchEdit
### v1.1

[TwitchEdit](resources/popup.jpg)

After getting tired of spending the extra 10 seconds to navigate to my clip page directly, and then modify the URL by typing /edit at the end of it, I decided to write this little Chrome Extension which automates that process for you.  Once installed, any time you visit your clips page and click on a clip, you will see a brand new "Edit" icon which will take you directly to the clip in a **NEW TAB** (thank God) and allow you to edit it.

**Please note that this will not work if you have already edited your clip, or if it has been published for more than 24 hours**

[Get it on the Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/dechjnpdlchkchhgjnakdifhkdlhloob/publish-accepted?authuser=0&hl=en)

If you appreciate what I've done, please feel free to head over to my Twitch channel: [ShermanZero](https://twitch.tv/ShermanZero) and drop a follow to show your support and appreciation!
